<h1> A compilation of books you must read before you die </h1>
<h2> by Rheaa Rao </h2>
<p> Books let you travel the world without a passport. They make staying in on snow days worth it. Here's a compilation of a few of the best ones.  </p>

<hr />
<p> Let's start with a list of authors. Feel free to add some more. </p>
<ul>
<li> Haruki Murakami </li>
<li> Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie </li>
<li> Anuja Chauhan </li>
<li> Joanne Harris </li>
</ul>

<p> Fun facts </p>
<ul>
<li> Murakami didn't start out as a writer...but as a bar owner. He also writes about running </li>
<li> Adichie gave a commencement speech at Wellesley in 2015. </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p> <strong> But if I had to choose </strong> between their work. Here's my list: </p>
<ol> 
<div>
<li> Hard boiled wonder and the end of the world </li>
<p> This is a absurd fantasy novel that boggles the mind. <br /> One of Murakami's best books. </p>

<li> Battle for Bittora </li>
<p> Popcorn galore! The perfect romance novel. <br />
 It is instrinsically Indian in it's humor without <br /> 
 subscribing to Indian cliches. Zain Altaf Khan is <br />
 the ultimate hero. </p>

<li> Americanah </li>
<p> A novel about immigrants growing into themselves <br />
 in an alien culture. A love story, a coming of age <br />
 story, but without the cliches. And yes, highly relatable. </p>

<li> Five quarters of the Orange </li>
<p> Joanne Harris is famous for her famous novel Chocolat. <br />
 But this one is a hidden treasure. Recipes, old childhood <br />
  memories, written in a very Arundati Roy style. </p>
